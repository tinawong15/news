# The Daily

## Overview
The Daily is my submission for Capital One's 2020 Software Engineering Summit. It is a web application designed to streamline the process of finding top headlines and relevant news articles. You can search for any article across the categories of Entertainment, Sports, and Technology.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Flask**: Python web microframework
  - `pip install flask`
- **flask-paginate**: paginate extension for Flask
  - `pip install flask-paginate`
- **Jinja2**: HTML templating
  - *Included in* `pip install flask`
- **Bootstrap**: open-source CSS framework
- **Bootstrap-select**:  jQuery plugin that allows for multiselection
- **Heroku**: platform as a service (PaaS)

## Features

#### News API Usage
When you visit the page for Entertainment, Sports, or Technology, you will see Top Headlines for the category.

For each article, the following information about the article is displayed on the website:
- title
- link to article, which will open in a new tab
- author (if exists. If not, the byline will only show the source.)
- source
- paywall (if exists for the news source)
- date (converted from a format like this: `2018-04-12T13:00:00Z` to a more readable format of `April 12, 2018`)
- description
- image (if exists. More information in next paragraph)

When the articles are listed, the image appears next to the description of the article. If there is no image associated with the article, the Bootstrap column dedicated to the image is eliminated and the description of the article will fill up the entire horizontal space. If there is an image associated with the article but the website does not have the permission to access the image, the Bootstrap column dedicated to the image will still exist, but it will be blank.

#### Search Functionality
You will be able to search on the Search page. You can enter one or multiple keywords into the search bar, and all of the keywords will be taken into account in the search. Then, you can select one category, two of the categories, or all of the categories to search your keywords in by using the dropdown menu. If you select a category/categories but enter no keywords, all results in the categories selected will be displayed.

If the search is successful, a message will flash at the top of the page, stating "Search is successful!"

#### Pagination
The pages that show the top headlines for entertainment, sports, or technology are paginated. Only 10 results are displayed at a a time, and you can click on the next page, previous page, or any other page by clicking on the pagination bar at the bottom of the page.

#### Paywalls
If an article is from a news source that has any form of paywall (prevents you from reading the article, limits the number of articles you can read per month, etc.), there will be a tag `âœ“ Paywall` next to the date of the article.

#### Error Validation
If The Daily is unable to access the News API for any reason (an incorrect API key, for example), a message will flash at the top of the page, stating "Unable to retrieve articles." On the Search page, if the user has not entered a category, or there are no results, a message will flash at the top of the page, stating "No results found. Please select a category/categories or try different keyword(s)."

If you are accessing a page not found on the website, like https://the-daily-ses.herokuapp.com/randompage, you will be sent to the 404 page. The 404 page will explain that the page you are trying to access is not found, and will redirect you back to the home page.
